# 2048

It's new!  It's a fad!  In the 1999 world we're living in, the game
2048 won't even be invented for another 14 years!  But now, the moment
you've all been waiting for â€“ a 32-bit Windows native implementation,
in Visual Basic 6.  We use [Visual SourceSafe
6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_SourceSafe) to
manage our code, but Github doesn't support that yet.

## Instructions

![A father and son excitedly install 2048 after receiving their boxed CD-ROM delivery!][users-of-2048]

The easiest way to run this game is to grab a compiled copy from the
[releases page](https://github.com/toothbrush/VB6-2048/releases), but
of course, you could also clone this repository and open the project
file (`2048.vbp`) in Microsoft Visual Basic 6.
